# Natural_Language_Generation_Model_Python ✍️

## Description

This Python application uses the powerful GPT-2 language model to generate human-like text based on user-provided prompts.  It provides an interactive interface where users can input prompts and view the generated text in real-time.  The application also calculates a simple coherence score to give users insight into the quality of the generated text.  This tool is versatile and can be used for creative writing, brainstorming, content generation, and educational purposes.

## Features

* **Text Generation:** Generates human-like text using the pre-trained GPT-2 language model. 🧠

* **Prompt-Based Input:** Users provide prompts to guide the text generation. ⌨️

* **Real-time Output:** Displays the generated text in real-time. ⏱️

* **Coherence Evaluation:** Calculates a coherence score based on sentence length to assess text quality. 🧐

* **Interactive Interface:** User-friendly graphical interface for easy interaction. 👍

* **Versatile Text Generation:**  Can generate various text types (stories, reports, dialogues, etc.). 📖

## Technologies Used

* **Python:** The primary programming language. 🐍
