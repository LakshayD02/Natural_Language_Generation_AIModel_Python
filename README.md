# Natural_Language_Generation_Model_Python
 An interactive application that leverages a pre-trained language model (GPT-2) to generate human-like text based on user prompts. The application can produce various types of text, such as stories, reports, or dialogues, making it a versatile tool for creative writing, brainstorming, or content generation.

# Technologies Used
- Python: The primary programming language used for development.
- Transformers (Hugging Face): A library that provides access to state-of-the-art natural language processing models, including GPT-2.
- tkinter: A built-in Python library used to create graphical user interfaces (GUIs).

# Features
- Text Generation: The application uses the GPT-2 model to generate text based on prompts provided by the user.
- Coherence Evaluation: A simple coherence score is calculated based on the average length of sentences in the generated text, offering insight into the text's coherence.
- Interactive Interface: Users can input prompts and view generated text in real-time, facilitating an engaging user experience.

# User Experience
- Entering a Prompt: Users type their desired prompt into a text area.
- Generating Text: After entering the prompt, users click a button to trigger text generation.
- Viewing Output: The generated text is displayed in a separate area, along with a coherence score to evaluate its quality.

# Potential Applications
- Creative Writing: Authors can use the tool to generate story ideas or expand on existing narratives.
- Content Creation: Marketers and bloggers can quickly generate content drafts or brainstorm topics.
- Education: Teachers can utilize the application to create writing prompts for students.
